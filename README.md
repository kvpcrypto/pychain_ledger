# PyChain Ledger

This ledger is one of the many application of blockchain technologies. The focus of this app is to create a simple user experience of making transactions on a blockchain with the help of 'Streamlit' to build the web interfaces for this python application.

Install Streamlit
_pip install streamlit_

After cloning the files, run _streamlit run pychain.py_ in the terminal which will then display the web address of the running application. A browser window should pop up showing the web aplication at http://localhost:8501.

The web application will prompt the user to input a sender ID, receiver ID, and an amount to create a transaction. After adding the block the transaction will be recorded in the ledger with the input info and hash for the transaction.
